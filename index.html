Hi there, this is Hao Xue, a year 2 master student in Biostatistics at Harvard Chan School of Public Health (See my <a href="https://github.com/xvehao/xvehao.github.io/blob/master/file/Hao'sCV.pdf"  target="_blank">CV</a><br>). 
  Before came to Harvard, I did my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China. 
  During my undergraduate, I was an active participant in mathematical modeling cotests. 
  My Final Year Project is Prediction of RNA Methylation Status From Gene Expression Data Using Classification and Regression Methods. 
<br><br>
I'm always eager to apply the mathematical and statistical knowledge I learned into solving real-life problems. 
  My current research interests lie in machine learning, statistical genetics, survival analysis and Electronic Health Record. 
  I'm working on three projects: 
  1) Bidirectional word embedding; 
  2)Integrating multiplatform genomic data; 
  3)Distributed Cox Regression
