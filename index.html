Hi there, this is Hao Xue, a year 2 master student in Biostatistics at Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Before came to Harvard, I did my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China. My Final Year Project is Prediction of RNA Methylation Status From Gene Expression Data Using Classification and Regression Methods. 
<br><br>
My current research interests lie in machine learning, statistical genetics, survival analysis and Electronic Health Record. I'm working on three projects: 1) Bidirectional word embedding; 2)Integrating multiplatform genomic data; 3)Distributed Cox Regression
