I was born and raised in Wenzhou, China, a coastal city famous for two things: One is its enigmatic local dialect (nicknamed Devil's Language in Wikipedia), the other is Wenzhouness businessmen who make their fortune all over the world. During my leisure time, I enjoy performing Chinese calligraphy and oil painting.
